To build Joe for Windows, you need to have installed:
    - Visual Studio 2010 or later
    - Python 2.x - native Windows version, not Cygwin
    - WiX Toolset 3.8 or later (only required to build MSI installer)

I would recommend installing VS Community 2013 and the latest revision of
Python 2.7.  The older VS Express C++ edition may work, but I haven't tested
it.  If you have Visual Studio 2012, you must have at least Update 1
installed because it includes the necessary components to target Windows XP. 
If you do not want the MSI, simply unload the "installer" project (in the
dist folder).  The MSI will only be built in the "Release" configuration.

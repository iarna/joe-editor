JoeWin todo:

JOE
X Add PuTTY termcap to JOE
* Change to ONLY use this termcap (yank search logic)
X Implement timer in read loop, probably using select
* Default to CRLF for new files.  (This might be in joerc?)
X Fix assertion when saving this file.
X FindNextFile problem with 'My Documents' (not really a problem, but still can't find it)
X Case-insensitive filename expansion
X Remove case-sensitivity from file listing.
...
X Turn on mouse support
* Point JOE to AppData/Local and install paths, load joerc + syntax highlighting.
  - See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310294 for info on application data.
* Fix DEADJOE on window close (update PuTTY with modded file count, quit command)
* Support UNC paths (much later)
X Hex editor column?  (Works in Linux)
* Shift-tab in file prompt pulls up file dialog (putty sends \E[Z)
* Default to My Documents folder.
* Ctrl-Left/Ctrl-Right would be nice.  I think normally this makes blocks, but that doesn't appear to be working.
X Make list sorting case insensitive. 
X Fix backup file/folder/can't write prompt
* Integrate with clipboard
* Change color of selected block to custom color -- not just reverse video.


PuTTY
* Load settings for PuTTY
  * Better color scheme, different font... In progress.
  X Remove scrollbar, scrollback buffer
X Yank connection dialog
X Yank registry storage for settings
X Get rid of dialog on exit (confirmation?) DONE
X Fix up title bar
* Custom colors (extend beyond basic sixteen)
* Get rid of items in system menu
* Context menu with Copy, Paste, Yank, perhaps others
* Replace with new items:
  - Full screen (keep)
  - Colors -> schemes
  - Open joerc
  - Open joerc directory


Common
X Fix build
X Implement window sizing notification
X Improve joe entry/exit (commandlines on entry, close up on exit)
X Set mouse cursor from Joe->PuTTY ==> Can't do this.
* Prompt on exit if there are unsaved files.  Cleanly joe thread afterwards.
* Extend color support.  Extra colors for:
  - Status line
  - Selected block
* Save color schemes into file format.
* Port over some of the better schemes from vim, visual studio.


ISSUES
======
X Mouse:
  X Change where character boundaries lie.
  X Mouse is a little sporadic.  Double click at the end of a file on an empty line: something gets selected.
  X Drag with long lines jumps column around a lot
  X Scroll wheel moves cursor when it doesn't move window.
  - Perhaps clicking on a block should clear it.
X Could not make backup file for file on the desktop.  (And it keeps prompting me!)
  Happens when I drag the file to joewin.exe as opposed to opening it from a blank editor.
X In another case, it copies the backup file into a folder!
X Tab-complete from "e:\mqal" clears to "e:\".  Similar for "\mqal" when running on E: drive.
X Crash on exit.
X ^TE <tab> crashes.


JOE ISSUES
==========
* ^KH in search/replace prompt draws screen incorrectly. -- Repro's in JOE/Linux too.
* What is the boundary for large files?  A 3MB file took a while to load (though it was probably disk access slowing it down).
* ^[ shows up at top of screen too often (mouse moves, every non-alphanumeric)
* JOE doesn't recognize UTF-8 preamble
* Hex editor with newlines/CRLF's?
